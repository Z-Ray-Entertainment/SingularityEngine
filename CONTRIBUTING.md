By contributing to apply to the following terms of development.

### The Branches ###
#### Master ####
This branch is always the lates stable release (in case of the current progress 
of develompent alpha release).
This branch is always functional and tested.
Only administrators are allowed do merge other branches into the master.

#### Stage ####
The stage is a pre release branch whitch intends to be the final testing branch
only if the stage branch is functional and well tested it is merged into the master.
It is also meant to be an official experimental brachn for external develper so 
they can use the latest feauters but may have to expect some issues or even crashes.
If this branch is found to be stable it can be merged into the master branch.

#### Test ####
The test branch is the first branch in which all development branches are merged 
to and the first tier where all different features are brought together and 
testet with each other.
Only if this branch is stable it is merged into the next branch (stage).

#### Developent branches ####
It is allowed to have as many dev brnaches as possible even for each individual 
developer for any purpose he/she/it wants.
But your only allowed to issue a merge request for your branch in to the test 
branch if youre dev branch is stable and barely tested.
Every developer is allowed to merge any other branch into his/her/it dev branch 
without restrictions.

### Who is allowed to issue merge requests? ###
Everybody is allowed to issue an merge request, but the final merge is always and only
done by project administrators. (Vortex Acherontic and Kentravyon).

### Merging ###
Anybody is allowed to request a merge but not to finly merge two different branches.
Every request is revisited by and administrator.
Only for his very own dev branch, if one exists, every developer is allowed to
merge any other branch into his dev branch.
Merges which are into the Test, Stage or Master branch are only allowed by
project administrators (VOrtex Acherontic and Kentravyon).
